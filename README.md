# 🌾 Empowering Farmers through HCI-Based Agricultural & Livestock Guidance

> **A Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) project with a user-centered prototype built in Figma.**

---

## 💡 About the Project

This is a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) design project aimed at supporting rural farmers and livestock caretakers in Bangladesh. Many of them lack digital literacy, access to expert support, and up-to-date agricultural knowledge. Our goal was to design an easy, accessible, and inclusive mobile app prototype that addresses these needs using HCI principles.

## 🎨 Designed in Figma

We created a **high-fidelity prototype** using **Figma**, focusing on:
- Simple UI for low-literacy users
- Local language and voice input support
- Offline functionality for remote users
- Participatory design based on real farmer feedback

## 📱 Key Features of the App (Prototype)

| Module                  | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| 🐮 **SnapFarm Diagnosis** | Upload photos or use voice input to identify crop/livestock diseases. |
| 🎓 **Virtual Academy**     | Access live or recorded videos on crop/animal care. |
| ⚠️ **Watch Alerts**        | Receive weather updates, disease alerts, and government notices. |
| 📚 **Information Desk**    | Searchable offline guide for farming and livestock FAQs and tips. |
| 👤 **User Profile & Registration** | Register using NID and profession to receive personalized guidance. |

> ✅ Voice input, Bangla support, offline access, and visual icons were added based on user testing.

## 🧠 HCI Design Approach

- 🎯 **User-Centered Design**: Farmers helped define features.
- 🎤 **Think-Aloud Testing**: Users tested while voicing their thoughts.
- ✅ **Task-Based Scenarios**: Uploading images, watching videos, searching tips.
- 🧭 **Simple Navigation**: Large buttons, icon-based layout, voice-friendly interface.

---

## 🧪 User Research

- 👥 **8 farmers interviewed** (4 crop + 4 livestock)
- 🧾 **Methods**: Phone interviews, notes, questionnaires
- 💬 **Insights**:
  - Prefer voice over typing
  - Need offline access
  - Requested community forums and access to affordable seeds/medicines

---

## 🔬 Literature Review Highlights

- AI-powered crop disease detection using images
- AR-based crop monitoring for real-time decision-making
- Importance of voice interfaces, local language, and trust in rural tech
- Community-driven learning improves long-term app usage

---

## 🚧 Limitations

- Small sample size (single region)
- Limited offline support for video content
- No built-in supply access or community hub (planned for future)

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

| Feature | Plan |
|--------|------|
| 📡 Offline video syncing | Download videos periodically for offline use |
| 🛒 Supply chain access | Let farmers order seeds, fertilizer, and medicine |
| 🌐 Community hub | Farmer-to-farmer Q&A forum |
| 🏥 Telehealth | Remote vet consultations for livestock issues |

---

## ✅ Conclusion

This HCI project successfully demonstrates how a simple, voice-supported, mobile solution can address real problems faced by rural farmers. Through participatory design, thoughtful research, and inclusive prototyping in Figma, we offer a strong base for a scalable smart agriculture app.
