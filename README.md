# 🌾 Empowering Farmers through HCI-Based Agricultural & Livestock Guidance

> **An inclusive mobile solution for rural farmers using Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles.**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Many rural farmers struggle to access accurate, timely, and easy-to-understand information on farming and animal husbandry. This project addresses that gap by building a mobile application with user-friendly, low-tech features that are inclusive for farmers with **limited digital literacy**, **poor internet access**, and **minimal formal education**.

## 🎯 Key Features

| Module                  | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| 🐮 **SnapFarm Diagnosis** | Upload crop/livestock images or describe problems using **voice input** for quick diagnosis. |
| 🎓 **Virtual Academy**     | Live and recorded **video-based tutorials** on farming and animal care. |
| ⚠️ **Watch Alerts**        | Real-time updates on **weather**, **diseases**, **government notices**, and **medicine availability**. |
| 📚 **Information Desk**    | A searchable offline guide with **farming tips**, **treatment info**, and **best practices**. |
| 👤 **User Profile & Registration** | NID-based registration and role selection (farmer/livestock keeper) to personalize content. |

> ✅ **Voice Typing**, **Offline Access**, **Bangla Support**, and **Visual Icons** ensure accessibility.

## 🧠 HCI Research and Design Principles Used

- **Participatory Design**: Farmers contributed ideas and feedback during every phase.
- **Think-Aloud User Testing**: Real users tested the prototype while speaking aloud their thoughts.
- **Task-Based Scenarios**: Hands-on tasks like uploading pictures, watching videos, or searching tips were tested.
- **Low Literacy Interface**: Visual-first, icon-driven layout with voice support.

---

## 🔬 Literature Review Highlights

- AI-based disease detection in crops using CNNs.
- AR-enabled crop monitoring and decision support.
- Voice-first, offline systems increase usage in low-literacy communities.
- Smart cattle systems and wearable tracking in livestock health monitoring.
- Importance of **trust**, **simplicity**, and **localization** in agricultural apps.

---

## 📊 User Study Summary

- **Participants**: 8 farmers (4 crop, 4 livestock)
- **Methods**: Interviews, phone calls, questionnaires
- **Feedback Included**:
  - Voice features are preferred over typing
  - Offline access is essential
  - Desire for access to medicines and seeds
  - Request for community chat feature

## 🧪 Future Enhancements

| Area                 | Plan |
|----------------------|------|
| 📡 **Full Offline Support** | Add offline syncing of videos and alerts. |
| 🛒 **Supply Chain Access** | Let farmers find/order seeds, fertilizers, medicines. |
| 🌐 **Community Hub** | Forum/chat system for farmer-to-farmer Q&A. |
| 🏥 **Telehealth** | Enable live consultations with vets. |

## 🚧 Limitations

- Small user base (regional sample only)
- Limited long-term usage testing
- No built-in seed or medicine marketplace
- Community and telehealth features not yet implemented
